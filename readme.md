# Fanstasy Realms Scoring App React Native

Fanstasy Realms is a Rummy style card game of collecting different fantasy themed cards. Each card has a specific power that contributes to the score. Some get bonuses when a specific combination are present others can cancel out cards. This system makes what is a light card game take just as long to score as is does to play. 

I created this app because at the time the offical app did not support the expansion and the app got pulled from the app store. I also wanted to leverage my react experiance try out a little react native for some mobile development.

## Installing / Getting started

Software Developed in Node / Yarn version 14.15.3

To install the application locally on your machine. Clone the repository then run the following commands.

```shell
cd {repo-location}/FantasyRealmsScoring
yarn install
```

To launch the app you can use expo. Expo will give you options to test it in the web or connect a device using the expo app. The web version is not reccomened because the css layout options are not 100% compatible. It will work but it will not look good.

```shell
expo start
```


## Features

* The scoring for the base game is 95% implimented.
* Blanking and Clear machanics are working.
* A couple cards require a custom selection. One of these "Island" is implimented. Three more cards need a simillar selector.
* The framework is setup to expand to expansion cards though they are not implimented yet.
